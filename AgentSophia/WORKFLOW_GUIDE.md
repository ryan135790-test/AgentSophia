## After Sophia Builds a Workflow

When Sophia generates and shows your workflow, here's what to do:

### ✅ Option 1: Execute Now (Recommended for most cases)
**Button:** "Execute Now"
- Launches the workflow immediately to all campaign contacts
- Sophia will handle all channels (email, LinkedIn, SMS, etc.) according to the schedule
- Best for: When you're confident in the workflow

### 👁️ Option 2: Test First (Recommended for first-time workflows)
**Button:** "Test First (5 contacts)"
- Sends the workflow to 5 sample contacts first
- Verify messages display correctly
- Check timing and sequencing
- Then execute to full list when confident
- Best for: New workflows or major changes

### 🎯 Option 3: Preview the Workflow
**Button:** "Preview"
- See the visual diagram of your workflow
- View all channels, timing, and sequence
- Understand the flow before executing
- Best for: Understanding the structure

### ✏️ Option 4: Edit Messages
**Button:** "Edit Messages"
- Customize email subject lines and content
- Adjust SMS and LinkedIn messages
- Change timing/delays between touches
- Add or remove channels
- Best for: Fine-tuning Sophia's recommendations

### 💾 Option 5: Save as Template
**Button:** "Save Template"
